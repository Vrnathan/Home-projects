  <h4><u>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web.</u></h4>

<p>

<h3> Reducing your exposure to cyber attack </h3>
<p>
  “Preventing, detecting or disrupting the attack at the earliest opportunity limits the business impact and the potential for reputational damage.”("Reducing your exposure to cyber-attack - NCSC Site", 2015) In this article, it argues that the earlier we mitigate the problem the less severe the problem will be as the articles advise using essential security controls to protect personal information on the web, it advises using security controls such as Boundary Firewalls and internet gateway, Malware protection and etc. On the other hand, another article argues to “Keep your browser secure. To guard your online transactions, use encryption software that scrambles information you send over the internet. A “lock” icon on the status bar of your internet browser means your information will be safe when it’s transmitted. Look for the lock before you send personal or financial information online” ("How to Keep Your Personal Information Secure", 2012). As by not using encrypted sites which has a lock on the search bar can potentially give vulnerability to the third-party to do a cyberattack, for example the cyber-attack which happened on 2017 to the Copeland Borough Council where their computer systems were hacked and demanded a ransom to allow the council to get access to them, it then cost them £2 million to repair the damage and rebuild their whole system.

<h3>Impersonators</h3>
<p>
  “Make sure you know who is getting your personal or financial information. Don’t give out personal information on the phone, through the mail or over the Internet unless you’ve initiated the contact or know who you’re dealing with”. ("How to Keep Your Personal Information Secure", 2012), furthermore this article also argues to be alert of impersonators as they can steal your information and can use it for the wrong reasons. But on the other hand, another article argues that “Your organization will experience a (data) breach at some point,” said John Kropf” ("Mitigating the Existential Data Breach Risk", 2014) this argues that all businesses are not safe and therefore will encounter some kind of attack at some point in time and so businesses must do their best to input high-level security. An impersonator can send an email to the user with a link and say that they have an account with you and ask for
your personal information, do not click on the link first check by searching up the company and calling their customers service and talk to them about it to make sure.

<h3>Risks of Social Media</h3>
<p>
  “It is important that your child understands the risks associated with disclosing information about themselves and how to manage their privacy and online 'friends” ("The risks of social networking", n.d.), this article argues that social media is not a safe platform to show and uncover details about their personal life as it can be used against them. Users should not overshare on the social network because an identity thief could be gathering information about the person and can potentially use it to access their accounts and expose their personal information. A user must never discuss work-related topics on social media because the third - party can target the business if too much information was given. There are always ways of information which are personal which can be leaked into the public and once it is out it cannot be taken back so therefore a user must be cautious. Furthermore, a user should not post details such as Full name, address, phone number and also account in publicly useable sites. This will make it harder for the identity thief to steal their information.

<h3>Enforcing a Password policy</h3>
<p>
  “Use strong passwords with your laptop, credit, bank, and other accounts. Be creative: think of a special phrase and use the first letter of each word as your password.” ("How to Keep Your Personal Information Secure", 2012). This article argues that using strong passwords can protect the user's computer from being exposed and the article is advising to be creative with the password and not to make an easy password which can be guessed easily. Furthermore, do not write the password down anywhere.
