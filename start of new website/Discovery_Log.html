          <h3>Week 1 </h3>

        <p> I started working with my VM which is a “Virtual Machine” which will be used for experiments for this unit and also maybe other units as well.I was told to log in to my own cloud server to see if there is any problem at early stages so that it can then be sorted out rather than when we actually start doing the experiments. I had to first log in to my own Linux server , to do that I had to go to a website called “myvm” and on that website it will show me my virtual machine details such as username , password, IP addresses, DNS name and also VM status.Below the virtual machine details there’s a section which says “Server Controls & Troubleshooting ” and what this had was a button to be clicked to start my virtual machine and so this started my server.Afterwards I installed ssh and launched the connection and it then opened up a window.

And inside the file it should include the tags "title", h1 and p , what i ve learned in this practical is how to create a web page with basic heading and paragraphs. We then learned to upload my web page to the Virtual Machine and used a software called WinSCP to connect my html file to my VM and so i followed the instructions but it didn’t work for me.
